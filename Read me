Li-Fi stands for Light Fidelity. The technology is very new and was proposed by the German
physicist Harald Haas in 2011 TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design) Global Talk on
Visible Light Communication (VLC). Li-Fi is a wireless optical networking technology that
uses light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for transmission of data. The term Li-Fi refers to visible
light communication (VLC) technology that uses light as a medium to deliver high-speed
communication in a manner similar to Wi-Fi.
Li-Fi is designed to use LED light bulbs similar to those currently in use in many energyconscious
homes and offices. However, Li-Fi bulbs are outfitted with a chip that modulates
the light imperceptibly for optical data transmission. Li-Fi data is transmitted by the LED
bulbs and received by photoreceptors.
